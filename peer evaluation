What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I was able to see through my peers project how to add a win/lose screen with a print statement. However the screen did not display upon completion of the game. 
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I like the bullets used and their size. It made it very clear how to play the game. 
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
I would suggest to add more lines of comments to explain what certain lines of code mean. 
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
The else in the function could have been better commented. There are a series of print statements that could be easily explained with a comment. 
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
No. The code was pretty staright forward. 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes. 
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Perhaps his/her vision for the game. I do like that he/she described what they would like to add to the game. 
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
Very clean code.
